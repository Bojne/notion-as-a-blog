It was now a general-purpose widget-rich responsive UI layer and data store that could serve as a dashboard, control panel, task manager, or a CRM system with mail-merge.","icon":"https://gine.me/static/favicon-9c941041f705958101858adb11cab153.ico","cover":"https://www.notion.so/images/page-cover/woodcuts_5.jpg"},{"children":[],"uri":"https://www.notion.so/14243601638c42329161a5122412ca7c","type":"bookmark","createdTime":1585642800000,"lastEditedTime":1585642800000,"link":"https://gine.me/posts/54fc4aaa38434d92afddf5d4b75b76b0","title":"gine-blog 挖坑详情 -- 基于 notion 搭建博客","description":"文章表添加keywords字段用于优化SEO @Mayne Yao notion 可以用来写作，但是不适合分享给别人看，也不适合交流 notion 马上(可能是明年吧，鸽鸽鸽~)要开api了，云端协作，自动同步岂不美哉😆 理想的情况是以 notion 作为写作的后端。文章发布后（share public access ），webhook发 netlify 的build 动作, gatsby build 的时候拉取 notion 的文章数据编译成静态页面。 根据Spotify开放的api，获取近期听歌排行及情感分析。以下公式计算当前情感状态0~1（sad~happy） H a p p i n e s s I n d e x = ∑ i = 1 n v a l e n c e i","icon":"https://gine.me/static/favicon-9c941041f705958101858adb11cab153.ico","cover":"https://www.notion.so/images/page-cover/woodcuts_4.jpg"},{"children":[],"uri":"https://www.notion.so/560986ba8efd4a22a726a2f5c8bb5eec","type":"bookmark","createdTime":1585642860000,"lastEditedTime":1585642860000,"link":"https://notion.conradlin.com/A-Space-for-Co-Creation-Collaboration-and-Community-3f0d64b2c6504466b9a80b9f96fd25a4","title":"A Space for Co-Creation, Collaboration, and Community","description":"I'm an entrepreneur passionate about building high-impact tech solutions to benefit the global community.
